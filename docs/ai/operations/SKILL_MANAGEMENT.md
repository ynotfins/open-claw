# Skill Management

How to discover, install, verify, and manage skills for the open--claw runtime.

## Skill Types

### Bundled Skills (openclaw-bundled)
- 50 skills ship with the build in `~/openclaw-build/skills/`
- Each has a `SKILL.md` defining its purpose, requirements, and tools
- Readiness depends on external CLIs, config values, or environment variables
- They are NOT separate packages with `package.json` files

### ClawHub Skills (community)
- Published at [clawhub.com](https://clawhub.com)
- Installed via the `clawhub` CLI into `~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/<slug>/`
- Each has its own `SKILL.md` and may have a `package.json`

## Commands

### Check skill status

```bash
pnpm openclaw skills list            # Table of all skills with ready/missing status
pnpm openclaw skills check           # Detailed requirements check per skill
pnpm openclaw skills info <name>     # Detailed info for one skill
```

### ClawHub CLI

```bash
npx clawhub search <query>           # Vector search for skills
npx clawhub inspect <slug>           # Fetch metadata without installing
npx clawhub install <slug>           # Install into skills/<slug>/
npx clawhub install <slug> --force   # Overwrite existing
npx clawhub update [slug]            # Update installed skills
npx clawhub uninstall <slug>         # Remove a skill
npx clawhub list                     # List installed skills (from lockfile)
npx clawhub explore                  # Browse latest updated skills
npx clawhub whoami                   # Check auth status
npx clawhub login                    # Authenticate (opens browser)
```

### After installing or removing skills

Gateway must be restarted to pick up changes:

```bash
pnpm openclaw gateway --force
# or
systemctl --user restart openclaw-gateway
```

Then verify:

```bash
pnpm openclaw skills list | grep <skill-name>
```

## Security Notes

- ClawHub skills are community-contributed; inspect before installing (`npx clawhub inspect`)
- Skills run within the gateway process with the same permissions
- Review `SKILL.md` for each installed skill to understand what tools it exposes
- Uninstall any skill that requests unexpected permissions: `npx clawhub uninstall <slug>`
