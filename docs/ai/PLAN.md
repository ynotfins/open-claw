## Phase 1 — Gateway Boot + Integration Scaffold ✅

**Goal:** Install dependencies, build OpenClaw, run onboarding, and verify gateway connectivity.

**Exit criteria:**

- [x] `openclaw.json` created with secure defaults (loopback, token auth)
- [x] 8 skill stubs created with valid `SKILL.md` frontmatter
- [x] Config template with 3-tier model routing
- [x] No secrets committed to repo
- [x] `docs/ai/STATE.md` updated with Phase 1 evidence
- [x] First agent chat: model `anthropic/claude-opus-4-6`, session confirmed
- [x] Control UI token auth confirmed via tokenized dashboard URL

## Phase 2 — First Live Integration (COMPLETE — 2026-03-14)

**Goal:** Unblock the gateway, connect the first integration, and verify end-to-end flow with an approval gate.

**Exit criteria:**
- [x] Gateway running on loopback with token auth — systemd-managed, port 18789/18792
- [x] `openclaw gateway status` succeeds
- [x] `openclaw health` succeeds — WhatsApp: linked, Telegram: ok
- [x] At least one integration fully connected end-to-end — weather skill, 42°F NY (runId 2a3f0990)
- [x] Approval gate tested — sandbox mode: all + exec-approvals.json security: deny; rm -rf blocked from real host (2026-03-14)
- [x] Audit log captures the full action chain — `/tmp/openclaw/openclaw-*.log`; exec-approv + sandboxed entries confirmed
- [x] Security review — no exposed secrets; sandbox active; exec-approvals configured
- [x] `docs/ai/STATE.md` updated with Phase 2 evidence

## Phase 3 — Runtime Hardening + Employee Operations (ACTIVE)

**Goal:** Maintain stable autonomous runtime and safely scale controlled employee workflows.

**Priority outcomes:**
- [x] Gateway/channel baseline stable on OpenClaw v2026.3.13
