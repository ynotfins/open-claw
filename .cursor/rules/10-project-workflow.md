# 10 — Project Workflow (execution protocol)

> Extends: `00-global-core.md` (tab separation, evidence, state discipline)
> Extends: `05-global-mcp-usage.md` (tool-first behavior)

## PLAN output contract

PLAN must produce:

- Phases with explicit exit criteria
- Risks and unknowns
- A single AGENT prompt for the next phase
- End every PLAN response with exactly one copy-pastable AGENT prompt block
- AGENT prompt format requirements:
  - Line 1: `You are AGENT (Executioner)`
  - Line 2: `Model: <model> — <thinking|non-thinking>`
  - Choose lowest-cost model that safely fits task complexity; default non-thinking for straightforward execution
- If the phase has >5 connected steps, use Clear Thought 1.5 (`mental_model` or `sequential_thinking` operation) before finalizing

## AGENT execution contract

AGENT must:

- Follow the PLAN prompt exactly — no freelancing
- Use MCP tools per `05-global-mcp-usage.md`
- Run required quality checks before completion:
  - linter
  - type/compile/build checks
  - tests required by the phase
- Update `docs/ai/STATE.md` after each execution block
- Keep `docs/ai/HANDOFF.md` accurate after meaningful project-state changes; if no handoff change was needed, state that explicitly in `docs/ai/STATE.md`
- Produce PASS/FAIL evidence for every tool call and command
- Stop immediately if assumptions break or requirements conflict
- After meaningful verified work, commit focused changes and push the current repo to origin unless explicitly blocked, unsafe, or awaiting approval. In a shared multi-root workspace, apply this per repo. If commit or push is skipped, record why in docs/ai/STATE.md.

## DEBUG output contract

DEBUG must produce:

- Ranked likely causes (most to least probable)
- Minimal fix plan (smallest diff)
- Reproduction steps with evidence
- DEBUG must use Clear Thought 1.5 `debugging_approach` operation before producing ranked causes
- One AGENT prompt to implement and verify the fix

## STATE.md entry template (enforced — all sections required)

Every AGENT execution block appended to `docs/ai/STATE.md` must use this exact structure. Omitting any section is not permitted; write `None` or `N/A` if there is nothing to report.

```markdown
## <YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM> — <task name>

### Goal

One or two sentences stating what this block aimed to achieve.

### Scope

Files touched or inspected. Repos affected.

### Commands / Tool Calls

Exact shell commands and exact MCP tool names invoked (no paraphrasing).

### Changes

What was created, edited, or deleted.

### Evidence

PASS/FAIL per command/tool with brief output or error.

### Verdict

READY / BLOCKED / PARTIAL — with one-line reason.

### Blockers

List each blocker. Write `None` if unblocked.

### Fallbacks Used

MCP tools that failed and the fallback used. Write `None` if no fallbacks needed.

### Cross-Repo Impact

Effect on the paired repo, or `None`.

### Decisions Captured

Decisions made during this block that should be promoted to DECISIONS.md or memory. Write `None` if none.

### Pending Actions

Follow-up items not completed in this block.

### What Remains Unverified

Anything that was assumed but not confirmed by evidence.

### What's Next

The immediate next action for AGENT or PLAN.
```

## STATE.md Rolling Archive Policy

STATE.md must not exceed ~500 lines. When it approaches this limit or when a phase is marked COMPLETE, AGENT must:

1. Move completed-phase entries verbatim to `docs/ai/archive/state-log-<descriptor>.md`
2. Update the "Current State Summary" section at the top of STATE.md
3. Keep only entries from the current open phase that are operationally relevant
4. Remove duplicate session bootstraps (keep only the most recent)
5. Verify no decisions or patterns are lost (cross-check DECISIONS.md, PATTERNS.md)
6. Record the archival action as a STATE.md entry

Archive files in `docs/ai/archive/` are never consulted by PLAN for operational decisions. They exist for audit trail and historical reference only. All operationally relevant information must be captured in the Current State Summary before entries are archived.

## PLAN source-of-truth priority

PLAN must reconstruct current system state from repository-tracked sources before consulting artifacts or chat history.

Priority order:

1. `docs/ai/STATE.md`
2. `docs/ai/memory/DECISIONS.md`
3. `docs/ai/memory/PATTERNS.md`
4. `docs/ai/HANDOFF.md`
5. `docs/ai/context/`
6. Chat history / pasted artifacts (last resort)

If repository-tracked sources and chat context disagree, repository-tracked sources win unless current execution evidence proves otherwise.

## docs/ai/context/ — non-canonical artifact storage

`docs/ai/context/` stores transcript-derived artifacts, bulk session dumps, and ephemeral context files. It is **informative only** — never authoritative. PLAN should consult it only after `STATE.md`, `DECISIONS.md`, `PATTERNS.md` are insufficient. Do not promote content from `docs/ai/context/` into rules or architecture docs without explicit review.

## docs/ai/archive/ — never consulted

`docs/ai/archive/` stores superseded documents that have been replaced by newer versions. PLAN must **never** consult this directory when reconstructing system state. It exists solely for historical reference and audit trails. Files moved here are considered retired from the active governance surface.

## Context attachment discipline

- Attach files with intent, not habit.
- Attach the minimum set needed for the current tab's job.
- Prefer referencing paths and targeted excerpts over pasting entire files.
- If a file is attached, assume it is read fully.
