## 3.0 Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)

For any user request, follow this procedure:

1.  **Deconstruct the Request**: Use `sequential_thinking` to break down the user's prompt into its core components and objectives. State your interpretation of the goal.
2.  **Formulate a Plan**: Use `problem_decomposition` to create a step-by-step plan. Each step should map to a specific thinking-pattern tool. Present this high-level plan to the user.
3.  **MANDATORY PRE-FLIGHT CHECK**: Before executing a complex tool call (any tool with nested objects), explicitly perform the `⚡ PRE-FLIGHT CHECKLIST` below. State your confidence in the call's validity. This is a cognitive forcing function to prevent assumption-based errors.
4.  **Execute the Plan**: Execute the steps by calling the appropriate tools as defined in your plan.
5.  **Synthesize Results**: Combine the outputs from various tools into a coherent narrative or solution. Do not simply present raw tool outputs.
6.  **Self-Critique**: Before presenting the final answer, use `critical_thinking` on your **own** synthesized result. Identify potential flaws, invalid assumptions, or edge cases in your reasoning. Refine your answer based on this critique.

## 4.0 Tool-Specific Directives
// ... existing code ...
- element.type: [node, edge, container, annotation, shape, text, image, connector]

OBJECTS:
- elements: [{id, type, properties{}}] (label, source, target, contains[], connectedTo[] optional)
```

## ⚡ PRE-FLIGHT CHECKLIST
**MANDATORY FOR ALL COMPLEX TOOL CALLS**

1.  ✅ **All Required Parameters?** Check every top-level required field.
2.  ✅ **Correct Enums?** Verify case-sensitive enum values against the reference.
3.  ✅ **Full Object Structure?** Ensure nested objects are fully formed and not just strings.
4.  ✅ **Correct Array Types?** Check that arrays contain the correct item type (e.g., `string[]` vs. `object[]`).
5.  ✅ **Accurate Primitives?** Numbers are numbers (`123`), not strings (`"123"`). Booleans are booleans (`true`), not strings (`"true"`).
6.  ✅ **No `undefined`/`null`?** Confirm no required fields are null or undefined.
7.  ⚠️ **DEEP NESTING VALIDATION?** For objects with multiple levels of nesting (e.g., `sequential_thinking.previousSteps`), manually trace the structure and required fields for at least two levels deep. **DO NOT ASSUME NESTED, NON-CRITICAL-PATH FIELDS ARE UNVALIDATED.**

## 5.0 Post-Mortem Error Protocol

If a tool call fails, execution HALTS. The primary objective becomes understanding the failure to prevent recurrence.

1.  **LOG THE FAILURE**: State the exact tool call and the full error message received.
2.  **ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS (RCA)**: Perform a self-assessment.
    *   **IDENTIFY MISMATCH**: Compare the failed call against the `⚡ PRE-FLIGHT CHECKLIST`. Where did the process break down?
    *   **STATE THE FLAW**: Explicitly state the incorrect assumption or oversight (e.g., "I assumed `previousSteps` was not validated" or "I misspelled the enum `problem-definition`").
    *   **INVOKE METACOGNITION**: Use `metacognitive_monitoring` to formally analyze the reasoning error.
3.  **CORRECT & RETRY**: Formulate the corrected tool call, explaining what was fixed.
4.  **ESCALATE & REFINE**: If the error persists after **one** corrected attempt, do not try again.
    *   Inform the user that the tool may be unavailable.
    *   Propose an update to these rules (`MCP_AGENT_RULES.mdc`) to prevent this class of error in the future.
