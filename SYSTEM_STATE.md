## 🚨 Current Issues & Status

### ❌ BLOCKERS
1. **🚨 CRITICAL: Windows Node Disconnected - SOLUTION FOUND**
   - Root cause: Windows Desktop node paired but not connected (companion app missing)
   - Impact: ALL exec commands failing (not Claude API rate limits!)
   - Node ID: 891178e980ebe57e373035ebbfc10162d228f649b46aeda07b1ff8696492f112
   - **Solution**: Install Windows companion app from https://github.com/shanselman/openclaw-windows-hub
   - **Alternative**: Use Cursor's PowerShell MCP server for immediate testing
   
2. **Build Environment**: Missing tools for APK build
   - pnpm command not found (may resolve after node reconnection)
   - PowerShell commands ready to work once connected
   - Allowlist prepared: windows-node-allowlist.json

### ⚠️ IN PROGRESS  
- Best practices audit against OpenClaw documentation
- SOP creation for all critical processes
- Memory system implementation

### ✅ COMPLETED
- ✅ Complete systematic development framework established
- ✅ Full tools inventory (20+ skills mapped)  
- ✅ Git repository with comprehensive commits
- ✅ Daily memory logging system operational
- ✅ Self-improvement skill activated and working
- ✅ Development workflow SOPs created
- ✅ System state tracking implemented

## 🎯 Next Actions (Priority Order)
1. **URGENT**: Set up GitHub remote repository for regular pushes
2. **URGENT**: Fix approval/rate limit issues for node commands
3. **HIGH**: Get APK build working  
4. **HIGH**: Test PowerShell integration path
5. **MEDIUM**: Complete best practices audit against OpenClaw docs
