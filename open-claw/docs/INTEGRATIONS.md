## Notes

- All integrations are accessed via MCP tools installed in the IDE environment.
- No integration credentials are stored in this repo.
- Integration availability is checked at runtime; failures are reported per the MCP failure policy in `.cursor/rules/05-global-mcp-usage.md`.
- New integrations can be added by creating a new MCP tool configuration outside the repo and updating this document.
