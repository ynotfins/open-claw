# Open Claw — Vision

## What is Open Claw?

Open Claw is a modular AI assistant platform that brings together code development,
communication, and workflow automation into a unified, extensible system.

## Why?

Modern development involves juggling many tools: code editors, chat platforms,
project trackers, documentation sites, databases, and deployment pipelines.
Open Claw aims to orchestrate these through a single assistant that understands
context across all of them.

## Goals

- Provide a natural-language interface to development workflows
- Leverage MCP tools for deep integration with existing services
- Maintain persistent memory across sessions for continuity
- Keep modules decoupled so each can evolve independently
- Remain transparent: every action is logged, every decision is traceable

## What Open Claw is NOT

- Not a replacement for IDEs or editors
- Not a hosted SaaS product (it runs locally or in your own infra)
- Not opinionated about language or framework (it orchestrates, not generates)
