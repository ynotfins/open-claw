# WhatsApp Official (Business Cloud API) Skill

## Status: BLOCKED
Meta Business not verified. WhatsApp Business API access not provisioned.

## Why Official API (Not Baileys)
OpenClaw ships with a built-in WhatsApp adapter using the Baileys library (unofficial,
reverse-engineered protocol). This skill uses the **official WhatsApp Business Cloud API**
from Meta instead, which:
- Is TOS-compliant and production-safe
- Supports business-verified sender identity
- Provides delivery receipts and read receipts via webhook
- Supports template messages (pre-approved by Meta)
- Has official rate limits and SLA

## Configuration Template
```env
# Add to ~/.openclaw/.env
WHATSAPP_BUSINESS_PHONE_ID=123456789012345
WHATSAPP_BUSINESS_TOKEN=EAAxxxxxxxx
WHATSAPP_VERIFY_TOKEN=your-webhook-verify-token
```

## Webhook Configuration
- Callback URL: `https://<gateway-public-url>/webhooks/whatsapp-business`
- Verify Token: must match `WHATSAPP_VERIFY_TOKEN`
- Subscribe to: messages, message_delivery_updates

## Meta Business Verification

1. Create Meta Business account
2. Create app in Meta for Developers
3. Add WhatsApp product to app
4. Complete business verification (documents required)
5. Register phone number for WhatsApp Business
6. Get permanent access token

## Approval Gate
**All outbound messages require approval unless replying within 24h window.**
