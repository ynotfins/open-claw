# Gmail Inbox Skill

## Status: BLOCKED
Google Cloud project not yet created. OAuth consent screen and credentials not configured.

## Required OAuth Scopes
- `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.readonly` — read inbox, labels, threads
- `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.send` — compose and send emails
- `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.modify` — mark read/unread, archive, label

## Pub/Sub Webhook Configuration
Inbound email notifications require a Google Cloud Pub/Sub topic:
- Topic: `projects/<PROJECT_ID>/topics/openclaw-gmail`
- Subscription: push to Gateway webhook endpoint
- Endpoint must be publicly reachable (Tailscale funnel or ngrok)

## Approval Gate
**All outbound sends require explicit human approval.**
- Draft is presented to the user via the approval channel
- User must reply `approve` or `deny`
- Denied drafts are logged but not sent
- No auto-send, no bulk send without per-message approval

- List unread emails with sender, subject, snippet
- Read full email body (text + attachments summary)
- Search inbox by query (from, subject, label, date range)
- Compose and send reply (approval-gated)
- Compose and send new email (approval-gated)
- Apply labels, archive, mark read/unread
